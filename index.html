      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>Suffering with fatigue, insomnia, and hormonal imbalances for over a decade, I couldn’t find any answers or solutions in traditional medicine. I refused to accept “this is normal”, “everybody feels this way” or “it’s just your age”. My quest to solve my own health issues led me to discover Functional Medicine. It is a different way of looking at your health. Rather than blocking your symptoms with drugs, Functional Medicine doctors focus on reversing the root cause of your health issues. This root cause approach can even slow down aging process!</p>
      <p>Having experienced my own health transformation, I completely changed the way I practice medicine, and opened Create Health institute. Stressful lifestyle, nutritional deficiencies, and toxic environment create inflammation that ages us, some faster than others. I developed a wellness system that allows your body to get back to optimal functioning we all have when we are younger. Remember the times when everything seemed effortless, and every time you looked at yourself in the mirror you liked what you saw? I discovered that at some point in our mid-30s to late 60s youth and vitality become a choice. I help men and women in middle age and beyond optimize their metabolism, lose extra weight, have abundant energy, and balance their hormones so they can feel like themselves again, look and feel younger, and live the best life possible.</p>
